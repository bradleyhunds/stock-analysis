Challenge 2 Analysis


Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to help our friend Steve compare different green stock tickers based on volume, price, and return.
We want to organize the data in a clean way that allows us to easily read these different stock metrics so that we can make informed decisions to help Steve's parents



Results
The tickers that we selected had a much higher average return in 2017 than in 2018. ENPH and RUN were positive both years
